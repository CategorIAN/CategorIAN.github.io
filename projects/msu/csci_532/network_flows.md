<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
A flow network consists of a directed graph \(G = (V, E)\) such that there exists \(s, t \in V\), where \(s\) is the source and \(t\) is the sink. Furthermore, there is a capacity function \(c: V\times V \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^+\) such that \(c(u, v) = 0\) for all \((u, v) \notin E \).
