<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Given polynomials \(a(x)\) and \(b(x)\), we want a fast way to multiply the polynomials \(c(x) = a(x)b(x)\). Suppose the degree of polynomial \(p\) is \(n\). Then, \(p\) can be uniquely represented as \(T(p)=(p(\omega_n^0), p(\omega_n^1), p(\omega_n^2), ..., p(\omega_n^{n-1}))\), where \(\omega_n\) is the \(n^{th}\) root of unity.
