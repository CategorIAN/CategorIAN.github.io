<h1>CSCI 447: Machine Learning Projects</h1>

[Project 1: Naive Bayes](/naive_bayes.md)\
[Project 2: K Nearest Neighbors](/k_nearest_neighbors.md)

For my machine learning course, my partner Ethan Skelton and I worked on four projects together. Each project involved creating a supervised learning model to make predictions on classes for classification sets and target values for regression sets. The sets. The data sets were from the <a href = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a>.
