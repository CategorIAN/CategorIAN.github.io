<h1>Ian Kessler's Professional Website</h1>

<p>
With a Master's degree in data science and a special interest in data engineering and deep learning, I look forward to a successful career in data engineering or machine learning engineering.
</p>

<p>
My experience from developing algorithms, machine learning models, and survey-processing software has given me skills in manipulating Pandas dataframes and Numpy arrays, especially with the functional programming paradigm aided by packages like functools, itertools, and tail-recursive. Furthermore, my background in mathematics--including linear/abstract algebra, combinatorics, and linear/nonlinear programming--has given me skills in generalizing software and optimizing computations.
</p>

<p>
I have developed coding skills in Python. For my research at CSU, I created object-oriented algorithms that addressed computer algebra problems. In my courses at MSU, I created algorithms that addressed data science and graph optimization problems. In my Machine Learning course, I worked on projects with my partner that trained models on various data sets to perform supervised learning. Our projects varied in methods of supervised learning, including Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks. We created our algorithms without the use of Python ML packages in order to have a better understanding of the fundamentals. In my Algorithms course, I wrote algorithms that utilized methods like Divide-and-Conquer, Dynamic Programming, and Ford-Fulkerson, which were applied to Discrete Fourier Transform, Segmented Least Squares, and finding max flow, respectively. For my final project of my Mathematics of Machine Learning course, I created a Deep Q-Learning model for the Traveling Salesman Problem and tested its accuracy with the Held-Karp algorithm.

<p>
My interest in organizing data to make effective decisions led me to an interest in database systems and data engineering. I have demonstrated data engineering skills with writing software in Python to analyze and clean Google Form data as well as manage Notion databases to help optimally organize gaming events. Using tools I learned in my Database Systems course, I aspire to map my data into a relational database to efficiently query data for effective management.
</p>

<p>
I am currently seeking opportunities in data engineering and machine learning engineering, especially in technology, finance, healthcare, and retail industries. I look forward to applying my skills to contribute in creating effective data science applications.
